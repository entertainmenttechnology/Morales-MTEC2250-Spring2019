# 20 Ideas for midterm 
The goal is to generate ideas, to start materializing them outside your head and to express thoughts visually. 

### About the sketches:
- Each Idea should be sketch out on a full sheet of paper, detailed enough for someone else to see it and know what you are thinking about.
- Each sketch should be simple, if you are spending more than 4 minutes on each you are taking too long.
- The idea doesn't have to be amazing, we are going for quantity at the beginning. Generating ideas, expressing them in paper.
- For this class, a good sketch is able to express an idea, it doesn't have to be a realistic drawing or have fancy shadows.

### About the midterm:
- Your project needs to exist in relation to an existing object in the world. An example could be a case for an arduino (you cannot do this example since we already do it in class and it is too simple).
- If it helps you think of ideas, it could solve a problem you have. (Think of the 3D printed vacuum cleaner nozzle I showed in class).
- It could replace an existing part, perhaps you want to modify your gameboy to fit your hand better.
- It can be produced though laser cutting or 3D printing. Bonus if it combines both technologies.
