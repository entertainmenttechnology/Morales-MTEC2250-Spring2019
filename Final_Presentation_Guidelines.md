## Final Presentation Guidelines
By now this would be your 3rd presentation in this class, hopefully you are getting confortable with it and getting used to what is expected. Just in case, here is a guiedline:

### Time
5-6 minutes +3 minutes for questions

### Key questions:
Why you chose this project? Why is this important to you?
What did you think would be the most challenging part before starting?
How did you project change during your design process?
What was the most challenging aspect of your work?
What you wish you knew before you started?
What would you do differently next time?
What is it made out of and why?

### Presentation should include Images:
* Images of sketches on paper
* Fusion360 Screenshots
* Photos of the process
* Photos of the assembly
* Final part in physical world context (if it is a phone case, show it with your phone in it)
* Bring fabricated part

Unless it is impossible to bring (It's too big, it's permanently installed), bring it to class. If this is the case, make sure to work extra hard documenting it.
If your project did't work, bring it as well. Part of your grade is a having a project that works, but if it didn't work be prepare to explain everything you learned in the process. A great presentation of the documentation of what went wrong is as valuable as a "working" part.

Any questions? Feel free to reach out on the slack or over email.
