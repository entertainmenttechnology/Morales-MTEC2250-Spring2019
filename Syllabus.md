## Description
A companion course to MTEC 2280, Ins and Outs, 3D Fabrication for Physical Computing is a project-oriented course that focuses on digital fabrication techniques in emerging media practices. Students deepen their knowledge of 3D design tools for use in CNC, laser cutters, 3D printers and printed circuit boards.

Students also explore and experiment with different materials available for the different fabrication machines.

## Instructor Notes
We will cover basic concepts of 3D modeling using Autodesk Fusion 360, in particular, focused on 3D printing and laser cutting. The course will be a combination of hands-on workshops, lecture, and in-class discussion.

Students are expected to spend at least 3-5 hours weekly outside of the scheduled time in class to complete assignments and advance projects. Midterm and Final Projects may require additional time, depending on your ambition. Budget more time each week that may be needed.

Each student is also responsible for maintaining a Github Repository, updating regularly to include process and documentation.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply the prototyping process, from research to prototype
- Ability to sketch ideas on paper and through 3D modeling
- Ability to design for existing objects (fit, tolerances, measuring)
- Basic understanding of analog and digital fabrication techniques
- Design files for 3D printing and laser cutting
- Documenting your work

## Grading
- Participation 20%
- Assignments 30%
- Mid-term 20%
- Final 30%

    *All work must be submitted on time, even if you are absent on that class day. Any late assignment will drop one letter grade per class session that it is late.*

## Grading Rubric

| Value | Excellent | Good | Fair | Poor | Unsatisfactory | 
|-------|-----------|------|----|----|----|
| Concept |Core concept is intriguing, original, and well-explored |Core concept is intriguing but lacking in examination | Core concept is present and supported by the work |Core ideas are scattered without consideration |No clear concept, or work doesn’t reflect it |
| Progress |Clear and consistent progress from ideation to execution|Progress was made, but was not consistent| Evidence of procrastination, “last minute” pushes or crunch|	Lack of progress in 1-2 areas resulting in project deficiencies|	Little to no progress shown on the project|
|Presentation|Concept is clearly presented and strongly supported through audio, visuals, interaction, and narrative (if applicable)|	Concept is supported through presentation, but 2 or more areas of the design are lacking or distracting|	Concept is weakly supported through presentation, project requirements met at a “bare minimum” level|	1-2 presentation requirements are not met.|	3+ presentation requirements are not met.|
|Skills|Clear demonstration of skills in all development areas (visual, text, audio, interaction, programming)|	Clear demonstration of skill in 2+ development areas	|Demonstrates skills, but omits topics covered in class.|	Evidence of skills, but underutilization of techniques learned in class|	Does not use any techniques learned in class.|
|Collaboration|Consistently provides honest, supportive feedback to peers, responsible in meeting team goals, communicates effectively.|	Generally supportive, responsible, and good communication, with a few issues|	Multiple issues/problems with collaboration, meeting goals, or communicating|	Little to no evidence of communication, goal setting, and collaboration in a team setting.|	Disrespectful to fellow students work, with negative impacts to class/team dynamics.|

## Academic Integrity Standards

Students and all others who work with information, ideas, texts, images, music, inventions, and other intellectual property owe their audience and sources accuracy and honesty in using, crediting, and citing sources. As a community of intellectual and professional workers, the College recognizes its responsibility for providing instruction in information literacy and academic integrity, offering models of good practice, and responding vigilantly and appropriately to infractions of academic integrity. Accordingly, academic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York and at New York City College of Technology and is punishable by penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion. The complete text of the College policy on Academic Integrity may be found in the catalog.

*Instructor’s note:* all borrowed text, code, or media used for this course must be attributed to the original creator. Any direct text quotes from another source must be specified with quotes and appropriately cited. Code borrowed from another source at more than four lines in length must be attributed as a //comment within the code itself. If you are unsure of whether or not your work may constitute plagiarism, please check with your instructor before submitting. Any instance of plagiarism will be reported to the MTEC Program Director as well as the Chair of ENT.

## Course Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations, students must first be registered with the Student Support Services Program (SSSP). Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with Ms. Linda Buist, the program manager of SSSP (Phone: 718–260–5143, e-mail: [lbuist@citytech.cuny.edu](mailto:lbuist@citytech.cuny.edu)). If you have already registered with SSSP, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.

## Participation **Policy**

- Students are expected to attend every class, arrive on time, and actively engage/participate.
- **If you will be absent, or if you are running late, DM your instructor ASAP.**
- In the case of an absence, **contact a classmate for notes** and what you missed, check Github for assignments, and contact the instructor if you have additional questions.
- **All in-class activities are graded for participation**. Unexcused absences will result in a 0 for participation for the day.
- Unexcused lateness counts as 1/3 participation absence when up to 25 minutes late, 1/2 participation absence when 26-50 minutes late, and a full participation absence beyond that point.
- Participation absences may be excused in the following cases: documentation of illness provided by a doctor, religious observance with advance notice, official school-related activity (with documentation and advanced notice), and on a case-by-case basis for other critical events.
- In order to collaborate in group projects, a student must maintain a passing participation grade.
- **Midterm and Final Project critiques are mandatory** and cannot be made up. Missing a critique will result in a deduction of one letter grade for the corresponding project.
