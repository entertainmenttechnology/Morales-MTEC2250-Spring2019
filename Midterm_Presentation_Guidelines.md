### Time

- 5-6 minutes +3 minutes for questions

### Key questions:

- Why you chose this project? Why is this important to you?
- What were some of your other ideas and why you decided against them?
- What did you think would be the most challenging part before starting?
- How did you project change during your design process?
- What was the most challenging aspect of your work?
- What you wish you knew before you started?
- What would you do differently next time?

### Presentation should include Images:

- Images of sketches on paper
- Screenshots
- Photos of the process
- Photos of the assembly
- Final part in physical world context (if it is a phone case, show it with your phone in it)

### Bring fabricated part

- Unless it is impossible to bring (It's too big, it's permanently installed), bring it to class. If this is the case, make sure to work extra hard documenting it.
- If your project did't work, bring it as well. Part of your grade is a having a project that works, but if it didn't work be prepare to explain everything you learned in the process. A great presentation of the documentation of what went wrong is as valuable as a "working" part.

Any questions? Feel free to reach out on the slack or over email.
